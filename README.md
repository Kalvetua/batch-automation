# Batch Automation

This repository serves to list miscellaneous batch scripts that were created with the intended purpose of automating various, otherwise dull or tedious, tasks. By hosting the scripts here, they remain easily accessible from any device that has access to the internet, instead of gathering dust in my local folders- where they would be inaccessible should they be needed by someone.
