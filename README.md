# Batch Automation

This repository serves to list miscellaneous batch scripts that were created with the intended purpose of automating various, otherwise dull or tedious, tasks. By hosting the scripts here, they remain easily accessible from any device that has access to the internet, instead of gathering dust on my local folders- where the scripts would be inaccessible to anyone in need of them.
